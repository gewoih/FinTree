# Aesthetic Playbook

Use this file to pick and execute one coherent visual direction.

## Direction Menu

Choose one direction per task unless the user asks for hybrid styling.

- Brutalist / Raw: oversized type, hard edges, stark contrast, exposed structure.
- Luxury / Refined: restrained palette, elegant spacing, subtle depth, polished typography.
- Editorial / Magazine: asymmetric grid, strong hierarchy, text-first storytelling.
- Retro-Futuristic: neon accents, metallic gradients, scanline/noise layers, stylized motion.
- Organic / Natural: soft curves, tactile textures, earthy palette, calm transitions.
- Playful / Toy-like: saturated colors, rounded geometry, elastic interaction feedback.
- Industrial / Utilitarian: utilitarian typography, dense information layout, practical affordances.

## Typography Pattern

- Pair one display face and one body face with clear contrast in personality.
- Keep body readability stable; apply expressive choices mostly to headings and accents.
- Avoid defaulting to Arial, Inter, Roboto, or system stack unless repository constraints require it.

## Color Pattern

- Build a dominant base and a limited accent set.
- Use CSS variables for all palette roles.
- Favor intentional contrast and hierarchy over evenly distributed colors.

## Motion Pattern

- Prefer one orchestrated entrance sequence over many unrelated micro-animations.
- Keep hover and focus motion subtle but expressive.
- Keep durations and easing unified across components.

## Spatial Pattern

- Use composition as a design signal: asymmetry, overlap, controlled density, or dramatic whitespace.
- Break grids intentionally, not randomly.
- Preserve navigation and content scanability.

## Implementation Guardrails

- Keep code maintainable and componentized.
- Preserve accessibility and performance budgets.
- If the repository enforces a design system, express visual identity through composition and interaction quality rather than violating established tokens.
